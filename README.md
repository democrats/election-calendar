# election-calendar

We've compiled datasets that list various boolean, categorical, and
date/time data relating to elections. This data is sorted by year; see
the 2018 folder for the most recent data and a detailed explanation.

If you'd like to contribute to this data set, please create a pull
request. When you do, in your PR comment please point to where you got
your information, preferably primary sources such as the Secretary of
State's website for the given state. Please add any links that you
cite to `footnotes.yaml`. (You can use the script `clean_footnotes` to
keep that file tidy.)
